[![Build Status](https://ci.manuelgu.eu/buildStatus/icon?job=Havok)](https://ci.manuelgu.eu/job/Havok/)

### Description
Havok is a robot made for [Robocode](http://robocode.sourceforge.net/) which was originally designed for a school project. It was written in Java.

### Building
You don't actually have to build a `.jar` file or similar to get this bot going. Simply add your binary path of the project under `Options -> Properties -> Development versions` in Robocode, then hit refresh. Everytime you compile the project it will automatically load in.

If you use maven the directory is located at `YourProtect/target/classes/`
